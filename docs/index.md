# dflockd

A lightweight distributed lock server using a simple line-based TCP protocol with FIFO ordering, automatic lease expiry, and background renewal.

## Features

- **Strict FIFO ordering** — waiters are granted locks in the order they enqueue, per key
- **Two-phase lock acquisition** — split enqueue and wait to notify external systems between joining the queue and blocking
- **Automatic lease expiry** — held locks expire if not renewed, preventing deadlocks
- **Disconnect cleanup** — locks are released automatically when a client disconnects
- **Zero dependencies** — single Go binary
- **Go client library** — high-level `Lock` type with automatic renewal and sharding, plus low-level protocol API
- **Runtime stats** — query active connections, held locks, semaphores, and idle entries via the `stats` command
- **Built-in benchmarking** — `cmd/bench` measures lock throughput and latency under concurrent load
- **Simple wire protocol** — line-based UTF-8 over TCP, easy to integrate from any language

## Quick example

```bash
# Acquire a lock with 10s timeout
printf 'l\nmy-key\n10\n' | nc localhost 6388
# Response: ok <token> <lease_ttl>

# Release (substitute your token)
printf 'r\nmy-key\n<token>\n' | nc localhost 6388
# Response: ok
```
